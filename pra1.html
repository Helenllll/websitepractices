                <p>I recently read The True Believer by Eric Hoffer. Itâ€™s a book about how mass movements evolve. With a lot
                    of historical examples, the book explains the patterns and common threads among them. Itâ€™s an insightful
                    book and reading it was a great learning experience for me. </p>

                    <p>What Iâ€™d like to share with you here is not the content of the book, though. Instead, Iâ€™d
                        like to share with you about the author.

                        You see, I didnâ€™t know about Eric Hoffer before. But I imagined he must be a famous
                        professor from a well-known university. I mean, what else could explain the depth of his
                        insights? The True Believer is an influential book. Here is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" >Wikipedia</a> put it.... <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/" >read more </a> more.
